Transforms and Transitions
        transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page
        Transforms don’t work on inline elements, just add display: inline-block;
        rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value
        skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes
        transform-origin:  control the origin from which your transforms are applied
        The order of transform functions does matter
        transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned
        transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take
        transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail
        A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition
