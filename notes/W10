MDN: Validating forms  
•	This is a client-side validation system
•	It catches invalid data on the client-side, and this makes it so that the user can fix it right away. It makes the user experience much more efficient and pleasant.

•	This is where you get the colored astrics of required forms. And will give the user an example of what their information should look like when they enter it.
•	This type of formatting can be achieved with key words
