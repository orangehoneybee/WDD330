Further Functions
        functions arefirst-class objects
        The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument
        If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument
        Immediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that is invoked as soon as it’s defined
        An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other part of the program
        recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met
        Collatz Conjecture - every positive integer will create a sequence that finishes in this loop
         'spaghetti code' -  more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend
        Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code
        Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors
        Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions
        A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was originally defined in
    
    AJAX
        a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading
        The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON
        requests can be made using the Fetch API
