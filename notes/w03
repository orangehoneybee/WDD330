An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces




const spiderman = {};

(In JavaScript, `const` means that the identifier can't be reassigned.)

It’s also possible to create an object using a constructor function. This example will also create an empty object:

const spiderman = new Object();
(first way is prefered less typing and such)



To call an object’s method we can also use dot or bracket notation. Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:

superman.fly()
<< 'Up, up and away!'
superman['fly']()
<< 'Up, up and away!'


The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure.
